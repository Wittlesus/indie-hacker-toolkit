## Full Product Description

### Stop reinventing your workflow. Start shipping.

You didn't quit your job (or wake up at 5 AM before it) to spend your time building spreadsheets and checklists from scratch.

Every hour you spend setting up a revenue tracker, writing a launch checklist, or figuring out how to organize customer feedback is an hour you're NOT spending on the thing that actually matters: **building a product people will pay for.**

This toolkit gives you the systems. You bring the product.

### What's inside

**5 battle-tested Notion templates** designed specifically for indie hackers and solo SaaS founders:

**1. SaaS Launch Checklist** (120+ items)
Skip the "what am I forgetting?" panic. This checklist covers every phase -- pre-launch, technical, marketing, launch day, and post-launch. Domain? Check. Payments? Check. Legal? Check. Product Hunt submission? Check. Post-launch metrics? Check. It's all here.

**2. Revenue Tracker**
Know your numbers without building dashboards from scratch. Track MRR, churn, ARPU, LTV, expenses, profit margins, and the key health ratios (LTV:CAC, Quick Ratio) that tell you if your business is actually working. Includes a 12-month annual overview.

**3. 30-Day Content Calendar**
A complete month of content, pre-planned across Twitter/X, Reddit, Indie Hackers, and your blog. Includes proven content formats (threads, build-in-public updates, tutorials, AMAs), example topics, a repurposing plan, and a metrics tracker. Stop staring at a blank screen.

**4. Customer Feedback System**
One place for all feedback. Feature requests with a priority scoring formula (Impact x Votes / Effort). Bug reports with severity levels. A user interview template and log. Monthly NPS tracking. Never lose track of what your users are telling you.

**5. Pricing Strategy Worksheet**
The most underrated lever in your business. This worksheet walks you through competitor analysis, value metric selection, tier design, feature gating, pricing page copywriting, and a framework for running pricing experiments. Stop guessing. Start pricing with confidence.

### Who is this for?

This toolkit is for you if:

- You're a **solo founder** building a SaaS product
- You're an **indie hacker** who values speed and systems
- You're a **developer** who's great at building but needs help with the business side
- You're tired of **reinventing workflows** every time you start a new project
- You want **proven frameworks**, not blank pages
- You use **Notion** as your operating system for work

This is NOT for you if:

- You're at a large company with dedicated ops, finance, and marketing teams
- You prefer building every system from scratch (respect, but this isn't for you)
- You don't use Notion

---

### Why this exists

I built these templates because I needed them myself. Every time I launched a new product, I found myself rebuilding the same systems: a launch checklist, a revenue tracker, a content plan, a feedback system, a pricing worksheet.

After the third time, I turned them into reusable templates. After sharing them with a few other founders, I realized other people needed them too.

These aren't theoretical frameworks from a business school textbook. They're the actual systems I use to ship and grow products as a solo founder.
