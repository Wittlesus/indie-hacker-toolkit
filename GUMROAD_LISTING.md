## Full Product Description

### You've downloaded free Notion templates before. Then you opened them.

Empty tables. Generic headings. No examples. No formulas. Just another blank page.

You spent 2 hours turning it into something useful. Then you did it again for the next project. And the next.

**This is different.**

Free Notion templates give you blank tables. This toolkit gives you the formulas, benchmarks, and frameworks that took us 100+ hours to research.

Not templates. Operating systems for indie hackers.

---

| Generic checklist | 120+ researched items with tool recommendations |
| "Prioritize feedback" | Scoring formula: Impact × Votes / Effort |

---

### What's inside: All 8 templates (5 core + 3 bonus)

**1. SaaS Launch Checklist** (120+ researched items)

Not just "Set up payments." Real action items with context:
- Pre-Launch: Domain setup criteria, hosting selection guide, legal requirements (ToS/Privacy templates)

- Marketing: Landing page frameworks, social setup, email list tools, pre-launch tactics

This template:
- **Formulas included:** LTV = ARPU / Churn Rate, Quick Ratio = New MRR / Churned MRR, Net New MRR = New + Expansion - Churned

### Who is this for?

**This is for you if:**
- You're a solo founder or indie hacker building a SaaS
- You're tired of downloading "templates" that are empty tables
- You want formulas and benchmarks, not blank pages
- You don't want to spend 100+ hours researching SaaS metrics
- You use Notion

**This is NOT for you if:**
- You're at a large company with finance/ops/marketing teams
- You prefer building every system from scratch
- You don't use Notion

**Honest disclosure:** This is a new product, built by an indie hacker for indie hackers. No fake testimonials. What you get is 100+ hours of research compressed into 8 templates with real formulas, industry benchmarks, and worked examples.

---

### Why this exists

After downloading my 10th free Notion template that was just empty tables, I realized: **nobody shares the actual formulas and benchmarks.**

Free templates give you structure. But you still have to:
- Google "how to calculate SaaS churn"
- Research "healthy LTV:CAC ratio"
- Find "SaaS growth benchmarks 2025"
- Figure out "feature request prioritization formula"

So I spent 100+ hours doing that research once. Then turned it into 8 templates with the formulas, benchmarks, and frameworks already built in.

These aren't theoretical. They're the systems I use to run my own SaaS products as a solo founder.

---

### What you actually get (file by file)

- 8 markdown files that import directly into Notion (5 core + 3 bonus)
- Pre-filled with formulas: LTV = ARPU / Churn, Quick Ratio = New MRR / Churned MRR, Priority = Impact × Votes / Effort
- Industry benchmarks: "Pre-$10k MRR: 20-40% MoM" (ChartMogul 2025), "LTV:CAC >3:1" (SaaS standard)
- Worked examples: Month 3 of $29/mo SaaS with 200 customers, full P&L calculated
- Decision frameworks: 10x Value test, 3-tier pricing builder, competitor analysis scoring
- 120+ researched checklist items with tool recommendations
- 30 days of example content posts across 4 platforms
- Customer feedback scoring system with prioritization
- Works with Notion free plan

---

### How to use

1. Download the template files
2. Open Notion > Import > Markdown
3. Upload the files
4. Customize to your product
5. Start shipping

Setup takes less than 5 minutes. The value lasts for the lifetime of your product.

## What Makes This Different From Free Alternatives

### Specific Differentiators

**1. Real Formulas, Not Empty Columns**

Free templates:
- Column labeled "Churn Rate" (you figure out the formula)
- Field for "LTV" (no calculation)
- "MRR Growth" (blank)

This toolkit:
- Churn Rate = Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start of Month
- LTV = ARPU / Churn Rate
- MRR Growth Rate = (Net New MRR / Last Month MRR) × 100
- Quick Ratio = New MRR / Churned MRR
- Priority Score = Impact × Votes / Effort

**2. Industry Benchmarks, Not Guesswork**

Free templates: "Track your churn" (is 10% good? bad?)

This toolkit:
- "SaaS companies pre-$10k MRR typically grow 20-40% MoM. Post-$100k MRR, 10-15% is strong." (ChartMogul 2025)
- "Keep monthly churn under 5% for healthy SaaS"
- "Target LTV:CAC ratio >3:1"
- "Healthy Quick Ratio >4"
- "Aim for 70%+ profit margin"

**3. Worked Examples, Not Blank Pages**

Free templates: Empty tables waiting for your data

This toolkit:
- Full Month 3 scenario: $29/mo SaaS, 200 customers, 60 new sign-ups, 17 churned, $5,800 MRR, 33% growth
- Every metric calculated: MRR, ARR, churn, ARPU, LTV, expenses, profit, ratios
- Shows what "healthy" looks like with real numbers

**4. Decision Frameworks, Not Generic Advice**

Free templates: "Prioritize your feature requests"

This toolkit:
- Feature prioritization formula: (Impact × Votes) / Effort
- 10x Value pricing test: "Customers should get 10× more value than they pay"
- 3-tier pricing allocation: "20% features in Basic, 60% in Pro, 100% in Enterprise"
- Content repurposing: "1 blog post → 5 Twitter threads, 3 Reddit posts, 1 newsletter"

**5. Research Compressed, Not Hours of Googling**

Building these from scratch requires researching:
- SaaS financial formulas (3 hours)
- Industry benchmarks and ratios (5 hours)
- Launch checklist items across 5 phases (8 hours)
- Content formats and platform strategies (6 hours)
- Feature prioritization methods (2 hours)
- Pricing psychology and tier design (4 hours)
- Customer feedback systems (3 hours)
- NPS tracking and follow-up questions (2 hours)

**Total time saved: 100+ hours of research**

We did it once. You get the results.

**6. Built for Indie Hackers, Not Enterprise Teams**

Free templates are often:
- Corporate project management templates
- Built for teams of 10+
- Require integrations and paid tools
- Over-engineered for solo founders

This toolkit:
- Designed for 1-person SaaS companies
- Works with Notion free plan
- No integrations required
- Just the essentials, no bloat

**7. Honest Product, No Fake Social Proof**

This is a new product. You won't find:
- Fake testimonials
- "10,000+ founders use this" claims
- Manufactured scarcity ("only 5 left!")

What you will find:
- Transparent about what you're getting
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- Built by indie hacker who needed this
- Actual research, not fluff
