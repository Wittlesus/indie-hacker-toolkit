# Customer Acquisition Playbook for $0 Budget

> 20+ proven acquisition channels for bootstrapped SaaS founders. Ranked by effort, impact, and time to results. No paid ads required.

---

## How to Use This Playbook

**The brutal truth:** Most acquisition channels take 3-6 months to show results. You can't try everything at once. This playbook helps you:

1. **Pick 2-3 channels** that match your product and strengths
2. **Execute the Week 1 Action Items** to get started immediately
3. **Track what's working** using the metrics table at the end
4. **Double down** on the channels that convert, kill the rest

### The Prioritization Framework

Each channel is rated on:
- **Effort:** How much time per week (Low = 2-4 hrs, Medium = 5-8 hrs, High = 10+ hrs)
- **Impact:** Expected MRR within 6 months (Low = $0-500, Medium = $500-2k, High = $2k+)
- **Time to First Customer:** How long until your first paying customer from this channel
- **Scalability:** Can this channel grow as you grow, or does it cap out?

## The Channels (Ranked by ROI for Solo Founders)

### Tier 1: Highest ROI (Start Here)

These channels have the best effort-to-impact ratio for solo SaaS founders.

---

#### 1. SEO + Content Marketing

**Effort:** High (10-15 hrs/wk for first 3 months, then 5-8 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** High ($2k-10k+ MRR at 12 months)
**Time to First Customer:** 2-4 months
**Scalability:** Excellent (compounds over time)

**What "good" looks like:**
- 10-20 high-quality articles published in first 3 months
- Ranking on page 1 for 3-5 target keywords by month 6
- 500-1,000 organic visitors/month by month 6
- 2-5% visitor-to-signup conversion rate

**Week 1 Action Items:**
- [ ] Identify 20 keywords your target customers search for (use AnswerThePublic, Reddit, customer interviews)
- [ ] Write and publish your first SEO article (2,000+ words, includes screenshots/examples)
- [ ] Set up Google Search Console and submit your sitemap
- [ ] Optimize your homepage and pricing page for your primary keyword
- [ ] Join relevant subreddits and communities where your articles would be valuable

**Common Mistakes:**
- Writing for yourself, not for search intent
- Targeting ultra-competitive keywords ("project management software" instead of "asana alternative for freelancers")
- Publishing thin content (500 words) instead of comprehensive guides (2,000+ words)
- Not including real examples, screenshots, or use cases

**Resources:**
- Ahrefs Keyword Generator (free tier)
- AnswerThePublic for question-based keywords
- AlsoAsked.com for related searches

---

#### 2. Reddit (Niche Subreddits)

**Effort:** Medium (5-8 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** Medium ($500-2k MRR at 6 months)
**Time to First Customer:** 1-4 weeks
**Scalability:** Medium (caps at subreddit size, but works fast)

**What "good" looks like:**
- Active in 3-5 niche subreddits (not r/SaaS or r/entrepreneur -- too generic)
- 5-10 helpful comments per week, 1-2 posts per month
- DMs from users asking about your product
- 50-200 signups from a single well-placed post

**Week 1 Action Items:**
- [ ] Find 5 niche subreddits where your target customers hang out (not marketing/startup subs)
- [ ] Spend 1 hour per day reading and commenting (be helpful, don't pitch)
- [ ] Answer 10 questions with genuinely helpful advice (no links to your product yet)
- [ ] Build comment karma in each subreddit (50+ comment karma before posting)
- [ ] Draft 1 post that provides value first, mentions your product second (80/20 rule)

**Post Formats That Work:**
- "I built X to solve Y problem (here's what I learned)"
- "Show HN"-style demo post with screenshots
- Case study: "How I reduced churn by 40% using [your solution]"
- Ask for feedback: "Would you use a tool that does X?"

**Common Mistakes:**
- Posting in r/SaaS or r/entrepreneur (everyone there is selling, not buying)
- Posting a link with no context or value
- Arguing with negative comments (ruins your reputation)
- Spamming multiple subreddits with the same post

**Best Subreddits by Niche:**
- **Developer tools:** r/webdev, r/javascript, r/reactjs, r/golang, r/Python
- **Productivity:** r/productivity, r/notion, r/GTD, r/ObsidianMD
- **Marketing tools:** r/marketing, r/SEO, r/PPC, r/EmailMarketing
- **No-code:** r/nocode, r/Bubble, r/Zapier
- **Finance/SaaS:** r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness, r/startups (use sparingly)

---

#### 3. Indie Hackers

**Effort:** Low (2-4 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** Medium ($500-2k MRR at 6 months)
**Time to First Customer:** 1-2 weeks
**Scalability:** Low (community size is limited, but high intent)

**What "good" looks like:**
- Weekly milestone posts showing traction
- Active in the community feed (5-10 comments/week)
- Product page with testimonials and metrics
- 20-50 signups from launch post

**Week 1 Action Items:**
- [ ] Create an Indie Hackers product page (include pricing, screenshots, and your story)
- [ ] Post a milestone ("Launched X, here's what I learned")
- [ ] Comment on 10 other founders' posts with helpful advice
- [ ] Join 3 relevant IH groups (find via Explore > Groups)
- [ ] Share your revenue numbers publicly (even if it's $0 -- transparency builds trust)

**Milestone Post Formula:**
```
Title: Hit [$X MRR / Y users / launched] -- here's what worked

- Problem I'm solving
- What I built
- What worked (traction channel, pricing change, feature, etc.)
- What didn't work (failed experiments)
- Metrics (MRR, users, conversion rate)
- Ask (feedback, advice, intros)
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Only posting when launching (be active before your launch)
- Posting vague "I have an idea" posts (Indie Hackers respects execution)
- Not sharing numbers (the community values transparency)

---

#### 4. Twitter/X (Build in Public)

**Effort:** Medium (5-8 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** Medium-High ($1k-5k MRR at 12 months)
**Time to First Customer:** 2-6 weeks
**Scalability:** High (audience compounds)

**What "good" looks like:**
- 500-1,000 followers in first 6 months
- 5-10 tweets/week (mix of progress updates, lessons, tips)
- 1-2 viral tweets per month (20k+ impressions)
- DMs from interested users or potential customers

**Week 1 Action Items:**
- [ ] Update bio: "[What you're building] for [who]. Currently at [$X MRR / building in public]"
- [ ] Post your first "building in public" tweet (screenshot of your product + what you shipped today)
- [ ] Follow 50 founders in your niche (find via #buildinpublic, Indie Hackers links)
- [ ] Reply to 10 tweets per day from founders you admire (add value, not just "great post!")
- [ ] Share 1 lesson learned or metric every day for 7 days

**Tweet Formats That Work:**
- Screenshots of your product + context ("Just shipped X feature")
- Revenue updates ("Hit $500 MRR -- here's the breakdown")
- Lessons learned ("3 things I learned launching on Product Hunt")
- Polls ("Would you pay $X/mo for a tool that does Y?")
- Threads (5-10 tweets breaking down a strategy or case study)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Tweeting into the void (reply to others first, build relationships)
- Only tweeting wins (people engage more with struggles and lessons)
- Over-automating (AI-written tweets feel robotic)
- Not including visuals (screenshots, charts, GIFs perform 3x better)

---

#### 5. Hacker News (Show HN)

**Effort:** Low (1-2 hrs for launch, then sporadic)
**Impact:** Medium ($500-2k MRR spike, not recurring)
**Time to First Customer:** 1 day (if you hit front page)
**Scalability:** Low (one-time spike, hard to repeat)

**What "good" looks like:**
- Front page of Show HN for 6-12 hours
- 500-2,000 visitors in 24 hours
- 50-200 signups (2-10% conversion)
- 5-20 paying customers if you have a strong offer

**Week 1 Action Items:**
- [ ] Read the Show HN guidelines (https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html)

- [ ] Draft your Show HN post title (format: "Show HN: [Product Name] -- [One-line description]")
- [ ] Prepare to respond to every comment within the first 2 hours (HN rewards engagement)
- [ ] Time your post for 8-10 AM ET on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday (best engagement)

**Show HN Post Formula:**
```
Title: Show HN: [Product] -- [What it does in 5-8 words]

Body:
- What problem you're solving
- How your solution works
- What makes it different
- Tech stack (HN loves technical details)
- Pricing (be transparent)
- Ask for feedback

Example:
"Show HN: CronPulse -- Dead-simple cron job monitoring for developers

I got tired of cron jobs failing silently, so I built a monitoring tool that pings you when a job doesn't run on schedule. Set up in 60 seconds with a webhook.

Tech: Next.js, Postgres, Upstash for job scheduling.
Pricing: Free for 5 jobs, $9/mo for 50 jobs.

Would love your feedback!"
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Posting without comment karma (you'll get flagged or ignored)
- Writing a salesy title ("The best project management tool ever!")
- Not responding to comments quickly (HN rewards early engagement)
- Posting on Friday-Sunday (low traffic)

---

### Tier 2: Medium ROI (Add After You Nail Tier 1)

---

#### 6. Product Hunt

**Effort:** Medium (10 hrs prep, 12 hrs launch day)
**Impact:** Medium ($500-1k MRR spike)
**Time to First Customer:** 1 day
**Scalability:** Low (one-time launch)

**Launch Day Checklist:**

- [ ] Reply to every comment within 1 hour
- [ ] Share on Twitter, IH, Reddit (link to PH page)

- [ ] Monitor PH leaderboard and celebrate milestones

**Common Mistakes:**
- Launching without an audience (you need at least 100 people who know about your product)
- Not responding to comments (kills engagement)
- Expecting massive revenue (PH is a traffic spike, not a revenue spike)

---

**Effort:** Medium (5-8 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** Medium-High ($1k-3k MRR at 6 months)
**Time to First Customer:** 1-2 weeks

Thought it might be relevant since [pain point you solve].

Would a 15-min call this week make sense? Happy to show you how [specific result].

[Your name]
[Product link]
```

**Common Mistakes:**
- Sending generic emails (personalization is 80% of success)
- Writing long emails (3-5 sentences max)

- Pitching on the first email (ask for a call, don't sell)

---

---

[Your name]
```

**Common Mistakes:**

- Not promoting the integration (build it, then market it)
- Expecting partners to do the work (you have to drive the relationship)

---

#### 10. Community Building (Discord, Slack, Circle)

**Effort:** High (10-15 hrs/wk)
**Impact:** Low-Medium ($500-1k MRR at 12 months, but high retention)

## The Acquisition Stack: 3-Channel Strategy

**Don't try every channel.** Pick 3 and go deep.

### Example Stack 1: Developer Tool

| Channel | Effort/Week | Expected MRR at 6 Months |
|---|---|---|
| SEO + Content | 10 hrs | $1,500 |
| Reddit (r/webdev, r/reactjs) | 5 hrs | $800 |
| Twitter (Build in Public) | 5 hrs | $500 |
| **Total** | **20 hrs/wk** | **$2,800 MRR** |

---

### Example Stack 2: B2B Productivity SaaS

| Channel | Effort/Week | Expected MRR at 6 Months |
|---|---|---|
| Cold Email | 8 hrs | $2,000 |
| LinkedIn | 6 hrs | $1,000 |
| Partnerships | 6 hrs | $800 |
| **Total** | **20 hrs/wk** | **$3,800 MRR** |

---

### Example Stack 3: Consumer/PLG Product

| Channel | Effort/Week | Expected MRR at 6 Months |

| Indie Hackers | 3 hrs | $400 |
| Twitter | 5 hrs | $600 |
| **Total** | **20 hrs/wk** | **$3,000 MRR** |

---

## Weekly Acquisition Routine

Block 15-20 hours per week for acquisition. Here's a sample schedule:

### Monday (4 hrs)
- [ ] SEO: Research keywords, outline 1 article
- [ ] Review metrics from last week (traffic, signups, conversions)

### Tuesday (4 hrs)
- [ ] SEO: Write 1,000 words
- [ ] Reddit: Post in 1 subreddit, comment on 10 posts

### Wednesday (4 hrs)
- [ ] SEO: Finish article, publish, share
- [ ] Twitter: Write 5 tweets for the week

### Thursday (4 hrs)
- [ ] Cold email or LinkedIn: 50 outreach messages
- [ ] Respond to DMs, comments, emails

### Friday (3 hrs)
- [ ] Community engagement (Reddit, Twitter, IH)
- [ ] Plan next week's content and outreach

---

## Metrics Tracking Template

Track metrics weekly. Focus on lagging indicators (revenue) and leading indicators (traffic, signups).

| Channel | This Week | Last Week | Trend | Visitors | Signups | Paid Conversions | CAC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEO | | | | | | | | |
| Reddit | | | | | | | | |
| Twitter | | | | | | | | |
| Cold Email | | | | | | | | |
| LinkedIn | | | | | | | | |
| **Total** | | | | | | | | |

**Definitions:**
- **Visitors:** Unique visitors to your site from this channel
- **Signups:** Free trial or freemium signups
- **Paid Conversions:** Free-to-paid conversions
- **CAC:** Customer Acquisition Cost (time spent x hourly rate / paid conversions)

---

## When to Kill a Channel

Cut a channel after 3 months if:
- [ ] Zero paying customers from this channel
- [ ] CAC is higher than LTV (Lifetime Value)
- [ ] You dread working on it (founder energy matters)

**Exception:** SEO takes 6-12 months. Don't kill it early.

---

## The 90-Day Acquisition Plan

### Month 1: Test & Learn
- [ ] Pick 3 channels
- [ ] Execute Week 1 action items for all 3
- [ ] Track metrics weekly
- [ ] Identify which channel feels like it has momentum

### Month 2: Double Down
- [ ] Kill the weakest channel
- [ ] 2x effort on the strongest channel
- [ ] Optimize for conversion (not just traffic)

### Month 3: Scale & Automate
- [ ] Systemize the winning channels (templates, processes, tools)
- [ ] Hire a VA or contractor for repetitive tasks (if revenue supports it)
- [ ] Test 1 new experimental channel

---

> **Tip:** Acquisition is a long game. Most channels take 3-6 months to show ROI. Don't channel-hop every 2 weeks. Pick your 3 channels, commit to 90 days, then evaluate. The founders who win are the ones who go deep on 2-3 channels, not the ones who dabble in 10.
