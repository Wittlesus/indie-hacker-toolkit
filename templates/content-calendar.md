# 30-Day Content Calendar for Indie Hackers

> Plan a full month of content across platforms. Duplicate this page each month and customize the topics to match your product and audience.

---

## How This Calendar Works (Read This First)

This isn't a random collection of post ideas. It's based on proven content frameworks:

- **AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)** - Classic marketing funnel for persuasive content
- **PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)** - Pain-focused content that drives conversions
- **BAB (Before-After-Bridge)** - Story-driven content showing transformation
- **The Hero's Journey** - Building in public as a narrative arc

Each week has a strategic focus. Each post type has a purpose. You'll find worked examples and copy templates below.

**Expected time:** 2-4 hours to plan the full month (Sunday afternoon), 30-60 min/day to execute.

## Content Strategy Overview

**Target Audience:** SaaS founders, indie hackers, solo developers, bootstrappers

**Core Content Pillars:**
1. **Building in Public** (progress updates, milestones, lessons) - 40% of content
2. **Educational/Tutorial** (how you built features, stack decisions) - 30% of content
3. **Business & Growth** (revenue, pricing, marketing strategy) - 20% of content
4. **Community & Engagement** (polls, questions, replies, collaborations) - 10% of content

**Posting Frequency Goals:**
- Twitter/X: 1 post/day (mix of threads and short posts)
- Reddit / Indie Hackers: 2-3 posts/week
- Blog: 1 long-form article/week

**Content Frameworks You'll Use:**

### AIDA Framework (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)
- **Attention:** Start with a hook (surprising stat, bold claim, question)
- **Interest:** Explain why this matters to your audience
- **Desire:** Show the transformation or outcome
- **Action:** Clear CTA (follow, reply, try the product, read more)

**Example Tweet Using AIDA:**
"I analyzed 50 failed SaaS launches. 43 made the same mistake. [ATTENTION]
They spent 6 months building before talking to a single customer. [INTEREST]
The 7 that succeeded? They pre-sold to 10 customers before writing a line of code. [DESIRE]
Here's the exact framework they used 👇 [ACTION - thread follows]"

### PAS Framework (Problem → Agitate → Solution)
- **Problem:** State the pain point your audience feels
- **Agitate:** Make it hurt - why is this problem so frustrating?
- **Solution:** Introduce your insight, tool, or method

**Example Blog Intro Using PAS:**
"You launched your SaaS 3 months ago. You have 47 sign-ups and 2 paying customers. [PROBLEM]
Every day you check Stripe, hoping for a new sale. Nothing. You're burning savings and losing confidence. Your family asks 'how's the business going?' and you lie. [AGITATE]
I was there. Here's the 5-step framework that took me from 2 to 50 customers in 60 days. [SOLUTION]"

### BAB Framework (Before → After → Bridge)
- **Before:** Describe the painful current state
- **After:** Paint the picture of the desired state
- **Bridge:** Show how to get from Before to After

**Example IH Post Using BAB:**
"Before: I spent 8 hours/week manually sending onboarding emails to new users.
After: I spend 0 hours. Emails send automatically. Conversion is up 40%.
Bridge: I set up this exact Loops.so workflow. Took 2 hours. Here's the template..."

## Common Content Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Posting Without Engaging
**What it looks like:** You post a thread and disappear. Zero replies to comments.
**Why it fails:** Social media algorithms reward engagement. If you don't reply, your posts get buried.
**Fix:** Spend 2x as much time engaging as creating. Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours.

### Mistake 2: Too Much Self-Promotion
**What it looks like:** Every post is "Check out my product!" or "New feature live!"
**Why it fails:** Nobody follows you to be advertised to. You get muted/unfollowed.
**Fix:** 80/20 rule. 80% value (education, entertainment, insights), 20% promotion. Teach generously.

### Mistake 3: Inconsistent Posting
**What it looks like:** 10 tweets on Monday, nothing for 2 weeks, 5 tweets on Thursday.
**Why it fails:** Algorithms punish inconsistency. Audience forgets you exist.
**Fix:** Post 1x/day minimum. Use a scheduler (Typefully, Hypefury, Buffer) to batch-create on Sundays.

### Mistake 4: Copying Others' Voices
**What it looks like:** "Just shipped a feature. LFG! 🚀" (when that's not how you talk)
**Why it fails:** Inauthenticity is obvious. You sound like every other indie hacker.
**Fix:** Write like you talk. If you wouldn't say "LFG" in real life, don't tweet it.

### Mistake 5: No Call-to-Action
**What it looks like:** You drop value but don't tell people what to do next.
**Why it fails:** People need direction. "Great thread!" then they scroll away.
**Fix:** End every post with a CTA: "Follow me for more", "Reply with your take", "Try the free version".

### Mistake 6: Focusing Only on Vanity Metrics
**What it looks like:** Celebrating 1,000 followers but 0 conversions.
**Why it fails:** Followers don't pay the bills. Customers do.
**Fix:** Track "content-attributed sign-ups" in your analytics. Use UTM parameters on links.

### Mistake 7: Not Repurposing Content
**What it looks like:** You write a great blog post and post it once.
**Why it fails:** 95% of your audience missed it. You're leaving reach on the table.
**Fix:** One blog post = 1 Twitter thread + 1 Reddit post + 1 IH post + 5 short tweets + 1 email. Milk every piece.

### Mistake 8: Ignoring SEO in Blog Content
**What it looks like:** Blog titles like "Thoughts on SaaS" instead of "How to Price a SaaS Product in 2026"
**Why it fails:** Nobody searches "Thoughts on SaaS". No traffic.
**Fix:** Every blog post should target a keyword. Use Ahrefs, Ubersuggest, or Google's "People also ask" to find topics.

### Mistake 9: Building in Public Without a Strategy
**What it looks like:** "Day 47 of building. Added a button today."
**Why it fails:** Low-value updates bore people. Unfollow.
**Fix:** Share **insights**, not just updates. "I added a button today. Here's why the placement increased conversions 18%."

### Mistake 10: Not Batching Content Creation
**What it looks like:** Writing each tweet fresh every morning. Takes 30 min/day.
**Why it fails:** Daily decision fatigue. You skip days when busy.
**Fix:** Batch-write 7 tweets on Sunday in 90 minutes. Schedule them. Done for the week.

## Content Calendar Review Checklist (Use Monthly)

At the end of each month, review your content performance:

- [ ] Which posts got the most engagement? What pattern do they share?
- [ ] Which posts flopped? Why? (Wrong audience? Bad timing? Weak hook?)
- [ ] What topics generated the most replies/DMs?
- [ ] What content led to sign-ups? (Check UTM parameters in analytics)
- [ ] Did I hit my posting frequency goals? (If no: batch-create more / lower goals)
- [ ] How many followers/subscribers did I gain? (Baseline: 5-10% MoM growth is healthy)
- [ ] What should I do more of next month?
- [ ] What should I stop doing?

---

> **Final Tip:** Batch-create content on Sundays. Write 7 tweets, 1 blog post, and 2 Reddit/IH posts in one 2-hour session. Schedule tweets for the week. Spend weekdays engaging with replies and comments. Engagement (replying, commenting, DMing) is 10x more valuable than posting. Think of posting as bait, engagement as the actual fishing.
