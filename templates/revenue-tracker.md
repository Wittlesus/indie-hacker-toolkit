## Monthly Snapshot

| Metric | This Month | Last Month | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MRR** (Monthly Recurring Revenue) | $0 | $0 | -- | Total recurring revenue this month |
| **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue) | $0 | $0 | -- | **Formula:** MRR x 12 |
| **New MRR** (from new customers) | $0 | $0 | -- | MRR from customers who signed up this month |
| **Expansion MRR** (upgrades) | $0 | $0 | -- | Additional MRR from existing customers upgrading |
| **Churned MRR** (cancellations) | $0 | $0 | -- | MRR lost from cancellations this month |
| **Net New MRR** | $0 | $0 | -- | **Formula:** New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR |
| **MRR Growth Rate** | 0% | 0% | -- | **Formula:** (Net New MRR / Last Month MRR) x 100 |

### Worked Example: Month 3 of a $29/mo SaaS

| Metric | This Month | Last Month | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MRR** | $5,800 | $4,350 | +$1,450 (+33%) |
| **ARR** | $69,600 | $52,200 | +$17,400 |
| **New MRR** | $1,740 (60 new customers x $29) | $1,160 | +$580 |
| **Expansion MRR** | $200 (10 upgrades from $29→$49) | $150 | +$50 |
| **Churned MRR** | $490 (17 cancellations x $29) | $290 | -$200 |
| **Net New MRR** | $1,450 | $1,020 | +$430 |
| **MRR Growth Rate** | 33.3% | 30.6% | +2.7% |

**Benchmark:** SaaS companies in early stage (pre-$10k MRR) typically grow 20-40% MoM. Post-$100k MRR, 10-15% MoM is strong. (Source: ChartMogul SaaS benchmarks 2025)

## Customer Metrics

| Metric | This Month | Last Month | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Customers** | 0 | 0 | -- | Active paying customers at end of month |
| **New Customers** | 0 | 0 | -- | New paying customers this month |
| **Churned Customers** | 0 | 0 | -- | Customers who canceled this month |
| **Churn Rate** | 0% | 0% | -- | **Formula:** (Churned Customers / Total Customers at start of month) x 100 |
| **ARPU** (Avg Revenue Per User) | $0 | $0 | -- | **Formula:** MRR / Total Customers |
| **LTV** (Lifetime Value) | $0 | $0 | -- | **Formula:** ARPU / Monthly Churn Rate (as decimal) |
| **Trial-to-Paid Conversion** | 0% | 0% | -- | **Formula:** (New Paying Customers / New Trials Started) x 100 |

### Worked Example: Month 3 Continued

| Metric | This Month | Last Month |
|---|---|---|
| **Total Customers** | 200 | 150 |
| **New Customers** | 60 | 40 |
| **Churned Customers** | 17 | 10 |
| **Churn Rate** | 11.3% (17/150) | 9.1% (10/110) |
| **ARPU** | $29 | $29 |
| **LTV** | $257 ($29 / 0.113) | $319 ($29 / 0.091) |
| **Trial-to-Paid Conversion** | 40% (60/150 trials) | 36% (40/111 trials) |

**Industry Benchmarks (2025 data):**
- **Churn Rate:** 5-7% monthly for SMB SaaS, 1-2% for enterprise, 10-15% for consumer. If you're >15%, you have a product-market-fit or onboarding problem.
- **ARPU:** Varies wildly. B2C: $10-30. B2B SMB: $50-500. Enterprise: $1,000+.
- **LTV:** Should be at least 3x your CAC (see below). If LTV < $100, you'll struggle to profitably acquire customers.
- **Trial-to-Paid:** 10-25% is typical for B2B SaaS. Below 10% means onboarding or product value is broken. Above 40% is exceptional.

## Key Ratios & Health Indicators

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status | Formula |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MRR Growth Rate** | 0% | >10% MoM | | (Net New MRR / Last Month MRR) x 100 |
| **Monthly Churn Rate** | 0% | <5% (SMB), <2% (Enterprise) | | (Churned Customers / Customers at Start) x 100 |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 0:1 | >3:1 (healthy), >5:1 (excellent) | | LTV / CAC |
| **Profit Margin** | 0% | >70% (SaaS standard) | | (Net Profit / Total Revenue) x 100 |
| **Runway** | -- | >12 months (safe), >18 months (comfortable) | | Cash on Hand / Monthly Burn Rate |
| **Quick Ratio** | 0 | >4 (healthy), >8 (hypergrowth) | | (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / Churned MRR |
| **Rule of 40** | 0% | >40% (SaaS gold standard) | | MRR Growth Rate + Profit Margin |
| **CAC Payback Period** | 0 months | <12 months (good), <6 months (great) | | CAC / (ARPU x Gross Margin %) |

### Worked Example: Month 3 Ratios

| Indicator | Value | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MRR Growth Rate** | 33.3% | >10% MoM | ✅ Excellent |
| **Monthly Churn Rate** | 11.3% | <7% | ⚠️ High - improve onboarding |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 3.2:1 ($257 / $80) | >3:1 | ✅ Healthy |
| **Profit Margin** | 62% | >70% | ⚠️ Close - optimize costs |
| **Runway** | 14 months | >12 months | ✅ Safe |
| **Quick Ratio** | 4.0 ($1,940 / $490) | >4 | ✅ Healthy growth |
| **Rule of 40** | 95% (33.3% + 62%) | >40% | ✅ Crushing it |
| **CAC Payback Period** | 4.4 months | <12 months | ✅ Excellent |

### What These Ratios Mean

**Quick Ratio:** If you're adding $4 of new MRR for every $1 lost to churn, you're in a healthy growth state. Below 2 means churn is killing your growth.

**Rule of 40:** Add your growth rate + profit margin. If it's >40%, you're balancing growth and profitability well. Most early-stage SaaS optimize for growth (80% growth, -20% profit = 60 Rule of 40).

**CAC Payback Period:** How many months until you recover the cost of acquiring a customer? If it takes 24 months but customers churn at month 12, you're losing money on every customer.

**Common Mistakes:**
1. **Not tracking MRR separately from one-time revenue.** One-time payments inflate revenue but don't predict future income.
2. **Ignoring logo churn vs. revenue churn.** Losing 20 $10/mo customers hurts less than losing 1 $2,000/mo customer, but logo churn signals product problems.
3. **Forgetting to include contraction MRR** (downgrades). Downgrades are a leading indicator of full churn.
4. **Calculating LTV wrong.** The simple formula (ARPU / churn rate) assumes constant churn and ARPU. For precision, use cohort analysis after 6+ months.
5. **Not tracking CAC by channel.** Organic might be $20 CAC, paid ads $200. Blend them and you miss the opportunity to double down on what works.

## Common Indie Hacker Mistakes with Revenue Tracking

1. **Vanity Metrics Obsession**
   - Mistake: Celebrating total user count instead of paying customers.
   - Fix: Track "active paying customers" and MRR. Everything else is noise pre-$10k MRR.

2. **Not Distinguishing MRR from Cash**
   - Mistake: Selling annual plans at $348/year and counting it as $348 MRR.
   - Fix: Divide annual revenue by 12. That $348 annual plan = $29 MRR.

3. **Forgetting to Track Expansion Revenue**
   - Mistake: Only tracking new customer MRR and ignoring upgrades.
   - Fix: Expansion MRR (upgrades, upsells, add-ons) is the highest-margin revenue. Track it separately.

4. **Ignoring Cohort Analysis**
   - Mistake: Looking at blended churn across all customers.
   - Fix: After 6 months, track churn by cohort (customers who joined in Jan vs. Feb). Early cohorts often have higher churn because your product was rougher.

5. **Celebrating Revenue Without Tracking Profit**
   - Mistake: Hitting $10k MRR but spending $12k on ads and hosting.
   - Fix: Watch Net Profit and Profit Margin religiously. Unprofitable growth is a ticking time bomb for bootstrappers.

6. **Not Setting Up Automated Reporting**
   - Mistake: Manually calculating metrics in a spreadsheet every month (and skipping it when busy).
   - Fix: Use Stripe's built-in MRR tracking or tools like Baremetrics, ProfitWell (free tier), or ChartMogul.

## Reading List: Learn SaaS Metrics Properly

- **"SaaS Metrics 2.0" by David Skok** (blog post) - The bible of SaaS metrics. Read this first.
- **ChartMogul SaaS Benchmarks Report 2025** - Real benchmark data across thousands of SaaS companies.

> **Final Tip:** Fill this in weekly for the first few months so you build the habit. Set a recurring calendar reminder for every Friday at 4 PM to update your numbers. After 3 months of weekly updates, you can switch to monthly. The discipline of tracking metrics weekly forces you to notice trends early (like churn creeping up) before they become crises.
