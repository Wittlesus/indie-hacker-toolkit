## Part 1: Competitor Analysis

Research 5-8 competitors or alternatives in your space. Include direct competitors, indirect competitors, and the "do nothing" alternative.

### Competitor Pricing Table

| Competitor | Free Tier? | Lowest Paid Plan | Mid Plan | Highest Plan | Value Metric | Target Customer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Competitor A | Yes | $9/mo | $29/mo | $99/mo | Per user | SMBs | Market leader, feature-rich |
| Competitor B | No | $19/mo | $49/mo | Custom | Per project | Freelancers | Premium positioning |
| Competitor C | Yes (generous) | $15/mo | $40/mo | $80/mo | Per user | Startups | Strong free tier, PLG |
| Competitor D | Freemium | $12/mo | $35/mo | $99/mo | Flat rate | Solo founders | Simple pricing, no per-user |
| Competitor E | Free trial only | $29/mo | $79/mo | $199/mo | Per seat | Mid-market | Enterprise focus |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |

### Competitive Pricing Insights

**Price range in the market:** $ _____ /mo (low) to $ _____ /mo (high)

**Most common value metric:**
- [ ] Per user / per seat
- [ ] Per project / workspace
- [ ] Flat rate (unlimited users)
- [ ] Usage-based (API calls, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Hybrid (base fee + usage)

**Where do you want to position?**
- [ ] Below market (compete on price -- dangerous for solo founders)
- [ ] At market (match competitors, compete on features/UX)
- [ ] Above market (premium positioning, compete on quality/brand)

**Competitive gaps / opportunities:**

_What are competitors NOT offering that you could? What are they charging too much for?_

## Part 2: Value Metric Identification

Your value metric is what you charge for. It should align with how customers get value from your product.

### Value Metric Evaluation

Rate each potential value metric on a scale of 1-5:

| Potential Value Metric | Easy to Understand? (1-5) | Scales with Value? (1-5) | Easy to Predict Cost? (1-5) | Total Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Per user / seat | 5 | 3 | 5 | 13 | Simple but penalizes adoption |
| Flat rate | 5 | 1 | 5 | 11 | Easy but leaves money on table |
| Per project / workspace | 4 | 4 | 4 | 12 | Good for project-based tools |
| Usage-based (API calls, etc.) | 3 | 5 | 2 | 10 | Scales well but unpredictable bills |
| Per feature tier | 4 | 4 | 4 | 12 | Common, flexible |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

### The "10x Value" Test

Your price should be less than or equal to 1/10th of the value you deliver.

**What value does your product deliver?**

| Value Type | Estimated Value per Month | How to Quantify |
|---|---|---|
| Time saved | $ _____ | Hours saved x hourly rate of user |
| Revenue generated | $ _____ | Additional revenue attributable to your tool |
| Cost reduced | $ _____ | What did they spend on alternatives? |
| Risk avoided | $ _____ | Cost of the problem if unresolved |
| **Total value delivered** | **$ _____** | |
| **Max reasonable price (value / 10)** | **$ _____** | |

## Part 3: Pricing Tier Builder

Design your pricing tiers. Most SaaS products do well with 3 tiers (plus optional free/enterprise).

### Tier Architecture

| | Free / Trial | Tier 1: Starter | Tier 2: Pro (Recommended) | Tier 3: Business |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Name** | | | | |
| **Monthly Price** | $0 | $ _____ /mo | $ _____ /mo | $ _____ /mo |
| **Annual Price** | $0 | $ _____ /yr (save __%) | $ _____ /yr (save __%) | $ _____ /yr (save __%) |
| **Target Customer** | Evaluators, tire-kickers | Solo founders, hobbyists | Growing startups, serious users | Teams, agencies, power users |
| **Value Metric Limit** | e.g., 1 project | e.g., 3 projects | e.g., 10 projects | e.g., Unlimited |
| **Feature 1** | | | | |
| **Feature 2** | | | | |
| **Feature 3** | | | | |
| **Feature 4** | | | | |
| **Feature 5** | | | | |
| **Feature 6** | -- | -- | | |
| **Feature 7** | -- | -- | | |
| **Feature 8** | -- | -- | -- | |
| **Support Level** | Community / Docs | Email | Priority email | Priority + call |

### Tier Design Principles

- [ ] Each tier should have a clear "who is this for" answer
- [ ] The jump from one tier to the next should feel natural as the user grows
- [ ] The middle tier should be the "best value" (anchor the top tier high)
- [ ] At least one feature in the higher tier should be a "must have" for growing users
- [ ] Free tier (if offered) should demonstrate value but create a reason to upgrade
- [ ] Annual pricing discount should be 15-25% (incentivizes commitment)

### Feature Gating Strategy

Decide which features go in which tier:

| Feature | Free | Starter | Pro | Business | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core functionality | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Must be in all tiers |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Gating principles:**
- Gate on **quantity** (number of projects, users, API calls), not on core features
- Gate on **convenience** (integrations, automations, exports) for higher tiers
- Gate on **collaboration** (team features, sharing, permissions) for Business tier
- Never gate critical functionality that prevents users from evaluating the product

## Part 4: Pricing Page Copy Framework

Your pricing page is a sales page. Use this framework to write it.

### Pricing Page Headline

Formula: **[Outcome] for [audience] at every stage**

Examples:
- "Simple pricing for teams of every size"
- "Start free. Scale as you grow."
- "Pricing that grows with your business"

**Your headline:** _______________________________________________

### Plan Descriptions

Each plan gets a one-line description that tells the user "this is for you."

| Plan | One-Line Description |
|---|---|
| Free / Trial | e.g., "Get started and see the value for yourself." |
| Starter | e.g., "For solo founders just getting started." |
| Pro | e.g., "For serious builders ready to grow." |
| Business | e.g., "For teams that need power and flexibility." |

### Feature Presentation

For each tier, list features using benefit-oriented language:

**Instead of:** "5 projects, 10GB storage, API access"
**Write:** "Up to 5 projects to organize your work, 10GB storage so you never run out of space, Full API access to build custom workflows"

### Social Proof on Pricing Page

- [ ] Number of customers or users: "Trusted by X+ founders"
- [ ] Testimonial from a customer on each tier (if possible)
- [ ] Logo bar of recognizable customers
- [ ] Money-back guarantee badge
- [ ] Security/compliance badges (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

### FAQ Section (Address Objections)

Write answers to these common pricing page questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Can I try before I buy? | |
| What happens when my trial ends? | |
| Can I change plans later? | |
| Do you offer refunds? | |
| Is there a discount for annual billing? | |
| Do you offer discounts for startups/students? | |
| What payment methods do you accept? | |
| Can I cancel anytime? | |
| What happens to my data if I cancel? | |
| Do you offer custom/enterprise plans? | |

### CTA (Call to Action) Buttons

| Plan | CTA Text | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Free | "Get Started Free" or "Start Free Trial" | No credit card required = lower friction |
| Starter | "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started" | |
| Pro (recommended) | "Start Free Trial" -- highlight this plan | Add "Most Popular" badge |
| Business | "Start Free Trial" or "Contact Sales" | |

## Part 6: Pricing Experiments Log

Track your pricing changes and their impact over time.

| Date | Change Made | Hypothesis | Result | MRR Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Common pricing experiments to try:**
- Raise prices by 20% for new customers and measure conversion rate change
- Add/remove a free tier and measure sign-up to paid conversion
- Test annual vs. monthly default on pricing page
- A/B test pricing page headlines
- Test different feature gates between tiers
- Offer a limited-time launch discount

---

> **Tip:** Most indie hackers underprice. If nobody complains about your pricing, you're probably too cheap. Raise prices for new customers, grandfather existing customers, and measure the impact. You can always lower prices -- but raising them later is harder.
