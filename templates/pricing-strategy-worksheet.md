## Part 1: Competitor Analysis

Research 5-8 competitors or alternatives in your space. Include direct competitors, indirect competitors, and the "do nothing" alternative.

### Competitor Pricing Table

| Competitor | Free Tier? | Lowest Paid Plan | Mid Plan | Highest Plan | Value Metric | Target Customer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Competitor A | Yes | $9/mo | $29/mo | $99/mo | Per user | SMBs | Market leader, feature-rich |
| Competitor B | No | $19/mo | $49/mo | Custom | Per project | Freelancers | Premium positioning |
| Competitor C | Yes (generous) | $15/mo | $40/mo | $80/mo | Per user | Startups | Strong free tier, PLG |
| Competitor D | Freemium | $12/mo | $35/mo | $99/mo | Flat rate | Solo founders | Simple pricing, no per-user |
| Competitor E | Free trial only | $29/mo | $79/mo | $199/mo | Per seat | Mid-market | Enterprise focus |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |
| | | | | | | | |

### Competitive Pricing Insights

**Price range in the market:** $ _____ /mo (low) to $ _____ /mo (high)

**Most common value metric:**
- [ ] Per user / per seat
- [ ] Per project / workspace
- [ ] Flat rate (unlimited users)
- [ ] Usage-based (API calls, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Hybrid (base fee + usage)

**Where do you want to position?**
- [ ] Below market (compete on price -- dangerous for solo founders)
- [ ] At market (match competitors, compete on features/UX)
- [ ] Above market (premium positioning, compete on quality/brand)

**Competitive gaps / opportunities:**

_What are competitors NOT offering that you could? What are they charging too much for?_

## Part 2: Value Metric Identification

Your value metric is what you charge for. It should align with how customers get value from your product.

### Value Metric Evaluation

Rate each potential value metric on a scale of 1-5:

| Potential Value Metric | Easy to Understand? (1-5) | Scales with Value? (1-5) | Easy to Predict Cost? (1-5) | Total Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Per user / seat | 5 | 3 | 5 | 13 | Simple but penalizes adoption |
| Flat rate | 5 | 1 | 5 | 11 | Easy but leaves money on table |
| Per project / workspace | 4 | 4 | 4 | 12 | Good for project-based tools |
| Usage-based (API calls, etc.) | 3 | 5 | 2 | 10 | Scales well but unpredictable bills |
| Per feature tier | 4 | 4 | 4 | 12 | Common, flexible |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

### The "10x Value" Test

Your price should be less than or equal to 1/10th of the value you deliver. This is the golden rule of value-based pricing.

**What value does your product deliver?**

| Value Type | Estimated Value per Month | How to Quantify |
|---|---|---|
| Time saved | $ _____ | Hours saved x hourly rate of user |
| Revenue generated | $ _____ | Additional revenue attributable to your tool |
| Cost reduced | $ _____ | What did they spend on alternatives? |
| Risk avoided | $ _____ | Cost of the problem if unresolved |
| **Total value delivered** | **$ _____** | |
| **Max reasonable price (value / 10)** | **$ _____** | |

### Worked Example: Email Marketing Automation Tool

| Value Type | Estimated Value per Month | How to Quantify |
|---|---|---|
| Time saved | $800 | Saves 10 hrs/mo on manual email work. Founder's time worth $80/hr. |
| Revenue generated | $2,000 | Automated abandoned cart emails recover ~$2k/mo in sales |
| Cost reduced | $300 | Replaces a $300/mo email tool + manual labor |
| Risk avoided | $500 | Prevents revenue loss from forgotten follow-ups |
| **Total value delivered** | **$3,600** | |
| **Max reasonable price (value / 10)** | **$360/mo** | But we price at $99/mo to be obviously good value |

**Key Insight:** If your product delivers $3,600/mo in value, you could charge $360/mo and still be "10x value." But pricing at $99/mo makes the ROI irresistible (36x value), which accelerates conversions and reduces sales friction.

## Part 2.5: Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Analysis

Before setting your price, survey 20-50 potential customers with these 4 questions:

1. At what price would this product be **so expensive** that you would not consider buying it? (Too expensive)
2. At what price would you consider this product **expensive**, but still worth considering? (Expensive)
3. At what price would you consider this product a **bargain** - a great buy for the money? (Bargain)
4. At what price would this product be **so cheap** that you'd question its quality? (Too cheap)

### How to Analyze Van Westendorp Results

**Step 1:** Plot responses on a chart (or use a Google Sheet). Find these intersections:
- **Point of Marginal Cheapness (PMC):** Where "Too Cheap" and "Expensive" lines cross
- **Point of Marginal Expensiveness (PME):** Where "Too Expensive" and "Bargain" lines cross
- **Indifference Price Point (IPP):** Where "Expensive" and "Bargain" lines cross
- **Optimal Price Point (OPP):** Where "Too Cheap" and "Too Expensive" lines cross

**Step 2:** Your acceptable price range is between PMC and PME. Your optimal price is near IPP or OPP.

### Simplified Example Results (20 respondents)

Responses clustered around:
- Too Cheap: $5-15
- Bargain: $20-35
- Expensive: $40-60
- Too Expensive: $70-100

**Analysis:** Acceptable range is $15-$70. Optimal price is likely $29-$49. Test $39 as your anchor.

**Common Mistake:** Asking "What would you pay?" instead of the Van Westendorp questions. People lowball when asked directly. The 4-question method reveals their true willingness to pay.

## Part 3: Pricing Tier Builder

Design your pricing tiers. Most SaaS products do well with 3 tiers (plus optional free/enterprise).

### Tier Architecture

| | Free / Trial | Tier 1: Starter | Tier 2: Pro (Recommended) | Tier 3: Business |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Name** | | | | |
| **Monthly Price** | $0 | $ _____ /mo | $ _____ /mo | $ _____ /mo |
| **Annual Price** | $0 | $ _____ /yr (save __%) | $ _____ /yr (save __%) | $ _____ /yr (save __%) |
| **Target Customer** | Evaluators, tire-kickers | Solo founders, hobbyists | Growing startups, serious users | Teams, agencies, power users |
| **Value Metric Limit** | e.g., 1 project | e.g., 3 projects | e.g., 10 projects | e.g., Unlimited |
| **Feature 1** | | | | |
| **Feature 2** | | | | |
| **Feature 3** | | | | |
| **Feature 4** | | | | |
| **Feature 5** | | | | |
| **Feature 6** | -- | -- | | |
| **Feature 7** | -- | -- | | |
| **Feature 8** | -- | -- | -- | |
| **Support Level** | Community / Docs | Email | Priority email | Priority + call |

### Tier Design Principles

- [ ] Each tier should have a clear "who is this for" answer
- [ ] The jump from one tier to the next should feel natural as the user grows
- [ ] The middle tier should be the "best value" (anchor the top tier high)
- [ ] At least one feature in the higher tier should be a "must have" for growing users
- [ ] Free tier (if offered) should demonstrate value but create a reason to upgrade
- [ ] Annual pricing discount should be 15-25% (incentivizes commitment)

### Feature Gating Strategy

Decide which features go in which tier:

| Feature | Free | Starter | Pro | Business | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Core functionality | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Must be in all tiers |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Gating principles:**
- Gate on **quantity** (number of projects, users, API calls), not on core features
- Gate on **convenience** (integrations, automations, exports) for higher tiers
- Gate on **collaboration** (team features, sharing, permissions) for Business tier
- Never gate critical functionality that prevents users from evaluating the product

---

## Part 4: Pricing Page Copy Framework

Your pricing page is a sales page. Use this framework to write it.

### Pricing Page Headline

Formula: **[Outcome] for [audience] at every stage**

Examples:
- "Simple pricing for teams of every size"
- "Start free. Scale as you grow."
- "Pricing that grows with your business"

**Your headline:** _______________________________________________

### Plan Descriptions

Each plan gets a one-line description that tells the user "this is for you."

| Plan | One-Line Description |
|---|---|
| Free / Trial | e.g., "Get started and see the value for yourself." |
| Starter | e.g., "For solo founders just getting started." |
| Pro | e.g., "For serious builders ready to grow." |
| Business | e.g., "For teams that need power and flexibility." |

### Feature Presentation

For each tier, list features using benefit-oriented language:

**Instead of:** "5 projects, 10GB storage, API access"
**Write:** "Up to 5 projects to organize your work, 10GB storage so you never run out of space, Full API access to build custom workflows"

### Social Proof on Pricing Page

- [ ] Number of customers or users: "Trusted by X+ founders"
- [ ] Testimonial from a customer on each tier (if possible)
- [ ] Logo bar of recognizable customers
- [ ] Money-back guarantee badge
- [ ] Security/compliance badges (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

### FAQ Section (Address Objections)

Write answers to these common pricing page questions:

| Question | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Can I try before I buy? | |
| What happens when my trial ends? | |
| Can I change plans later? | |
| Do you offer refunds? | |
| Is there a discount for annual billing? | |
| Do you offer discounts for startups/students? | |
| What payment methods do you accept? | |
| Can I cancel anytime? | |
| What happens to my data if I cancel? | |
| Do you offer custom/enterprise plans? | |

### CTA (Call to Action) Buttons

| Plan | CTA Text | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Free | "Get Started Free" or "Start Free Trial" | No credit card required = lower friction |
| Starter | "Start Free Trial" or "Get Started" | |
| Pro (recommended) | "Start Free Trial" -- highlight this plan | Add "Most Popular" badge |
| Business | "Start Free Trial" or "Contact Sales" | |

## Part 6: Pricing Experiments Log

Track your pricing changes and their impact over time.

| Date | Change Made | Hypothesis | Result | MRR Impact | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |

**Common pricing experiments to try:**
- Raise prices by 20% for new customers and measure conversion rate change
- Add/remove a free tier and measure sign-up to paid conversion
- Test annual vs. monthly default on pricing page
- A/B test pricing page headlines
- Test different feature gates between tiers
- Offer a limited-time launch discount

---

## Part 7: Price Elasticity Testing Guide

Price elasticity measures how demand changes when you change price. Most indie hackers guess. Do this instead:

### The A/B Test Approach

**Test:** Show 50% of new visitors pricing at $39/mo, 50% at $49/mo. Run for 2-4 weeks or 200+ visitors per variant.

**Measure:**
- Conversion rate to paid at each price
- Total revenue per 100 visitors at each price
- Customer LTV at each price (do higher-paying customers churn less?)

### Worked Example: $39 vs. $49 Test

| Metric | $39/mo Variant | $49/mo Variant | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visitors | 500 | 500 | -- |
| Trial sign-ups | 75 (15%) | 70 (14%) | $39 (slightly) |
| Trial-to-paid | 23 (30.7%) | 19 (27.1%) | $39 |
| Paying customers | 23 | 19 | $39 |
| Monthly revenue | $897 | $931 | **$49** |
| Revenue per 100 visitors | $179 | $186 | **$49** |

**Decision:** Despite lower conversion, $49 generates more revenue per visitor. Go with $49. Monitor churn - if $49 customers churn faster, the model breaks.

**Common Mistake:** Testing for only 50 conversions total. You need statistical significance - aim for 200+ visitors per variant minimum.

## Part 8: Competitive Positioning Matrix

Map yourself against competitors on two axes: Price (low to high) and Features (basic to advanced).

### Example Matrix for Project Management Tools

```
Advanced Features
        ↑
        |  [Asana Business]    [Monday Enterprise]
        |        $25/user            $50/user
        |
        |  [Trello Premium]    [Notion Plus]
        |        $10/user          $15/user
        |
        |  [YOU: SimpleTask]   [ClickUp]
Low ←---|        $8/user          $12/user        →  High
Price   |
        |  [Trello Free]
        |      $0
        ↓
    Basic Features
```

**Your Strategic Position:** Lower-left (affordable + simple) targets solo founders overwhelmed by complex tools. You compete on simplicity and price, not features.

**Positioning Statement Template:**
"For [target customer] who are frustrated by [competitor weakness], [your product] is a [category] that [unique value]. Unlike [competitor], we [key differentiator]."

**Example:**
"For solo founders who are overwhelmed by Asana's complexity, SimpleTask is a project manager that gets out of your way. Unlike Asana, we have zero learning curve and cost 1/3 the price."

## Part 9: Common Pricing Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake 1: Pricing Too Low Out of Fear
**Why it happens:** "Nobody will pay more than $9/mo for this."
**Reality:** Willingness to pay correlates with target customer. B2B buyers think $9/mo means "toy." Try $29-49.
**Fix:** Run Van Westendorp survey. Test higher prices on 50% of traffic.

### Mistake 2: Competing on Price
**Why it happens:** Competitor charges $99, so you charge $79 to undercut them.
**Reality:** Price wars are a race to zero. You can't out-cheap a VC-funded competitor.
**Fix:** Compete on positioning, niche, or differentiation. Charge the same or more, and explain why you're worth it.

### Mistake 3: Flat Pricing (No Tiers)
**Why it happens:** "I don't want to confuse people with options."
**Reality:** One price = leaving money on table. Some users would pay 3x for more features.
**Fix:** Offer 3 tiers. Capture budget-conscious users at $X and power users at $3X.

### Mistake 4: Charging Per-User for a Collaborative Tool
**Why it happens:** "That's what Slack does."
**Reality:** Per-user pricing penalizes adoption. Users won't invite teammates if it costs more.
**Fix:** Use flat-rate or per-workspace pricing for collaborative tools. Per-user works for individual-value tools (CRM, analytics).

### Mistake 5: Not Anchoring with a High Tier
**Why it happens:** Your tiers are $10, $20, $30.
**Reality:** Without an expensive anchor, $30 feels expensive. Add a $99 tier (even if few buy it).
**Fix:** Create a 4th tier at 3-5x your mid-tier price. It makes the mid-tier feel like a bargain.

### Mistake 6: Offering a Forever-Free Tier Too Early
**Why it happens:** "Freemium works for Slack and Notion."
**Reality:** Freemium needs massive scale and strong virality. For indie hackers, free users cost money (support, infrastructure) and rarely convert.
**Fix:** Start with a 14-day free trial, no credit card. Add freemium only after you hit $10k MRR and have proven paid conversion.

### Mistake 7: Annual Discounts Too Steep
**Why it happens:** "I'll offer 50% off annual to get cash flow."
**Reality:** 50% off trains customers to wait for deals. You devalue your product.
**Fix:** 15-20% annual discount is standard. Max 25%. Anything more signals desperation.

### Mistake 8: Grandfathering Old Prices Forever
**Why it happens:** "I don't want to upset early customers."
**Reality:** If you underpriced at $9 and now charge $29, you're subsidizing old customers forever.
**Fix:** Grandfather for 12 months, then migrate to new pricing with 60-day notice. Offer a loyalty discount (e.g., $24 instead of $29).

### Mistake 9: Not Raising Prices Annually
**Why it happens:** Fear of churn.
**Reality:** Costs rise (hosting, tools, your time). Static pricing = shrinking margins.
**Fix:** Raise prices 5-10% annually for new customers. Grandfather existing customers or give 90-day notice.

### Mistake 10: Pricing Based on Costs
**Why it happens:** "It costs me $3/user in infrastructure, so I'll charge $9."
**Reality:** Customers don't care about your costs. They care about value.
**Fix:** Price based on value delivered (10x rule). If your costs are too high relative to value, optimize costs or pivot.

## Part 10: Pricing Decision Framework (Use This When Stuck)

When you're unsure between two prices, use this decision tree:

**Question 1:** Do I have >50 customers already?
- **No** → Pick the higher price. Early customers are less price-sensitive. You can always lower it.
- **Yes** → Run an A/B test on new visitors.

**Question 2:** Is my market price-sensitive (consumers, small businesses) or value-focused (enterprises, agencies)?
- **Price-sensitive** → Match or slightly undercut market leader. Compete on features/UX.
- **Value-focused** → Price 20-30% above market leader. Compete on quality, outcomes, premium positioning.

**Question 3:** Do I have strong differentiation (unique features, niche focus, brand)?
- **Yes** → Charge a premium (20-50% above competitors).
- **No** → Match competitors. Differentiate first, then raise prices.

**Question 4:** Am I bootstrapped or VC-funded?
- **Bootstrapped** → Optimize for profitability. Charge enough to be profitable at 100 customers.
- **VC-funded** → Optimize for growth. Lower prices to maximize adoption, raise prices later at scale.

**Question 5:** Do I have pricing leverage (network effects, lock-in, high switching costs)?
- **Yes** → You can raise prices on existing customers with low churn risk.
- **No** → Grandfather existing customers when raising prices. Only charge new customers more.

---

> **Final Tip:** Most indie hackers underprice by 30-50%. If nobody complains about your pricing, you're too cheap. A good rule of thumb: 10-15% of prospects should say "that's expensive" when they see your price. If 0% say that, double your price and test again. Pricing is the fastest lever to grow revenue - a 20% price increase is a 20% revenue increase with zero extra work.
