# Indie Hacker Toolkit -- Not Templates. Operating Systems for Solo Founders.

**Free Notion templates give you blank tables. This toolkit gives you the formulas, benchmarks, and frameworks that took us 100+ hours to research.**

You've downloaded free Notion templates before. They looked promising in screenshots. Then you opened them and found... empty tables. Generic headings. No examples. No guidance. Just another blank page staring back at you.

This is different.

These aren't templates. They're operating systems for indie hackers -- pre-loaded with real formulas, industry benchmarks, worked examples, decision frameworks, and battle-tested systems you can use immediately.

## What Makes This Different From Free Templates

| Free Notion Templates | This Toolkit |
|---|---|
| Empty tables | Pre-filled with realistic examples (200 customers at $29/mo) |
| Generic metrics | Real SaaS formulas (LTV, CAC, Quick Ratio, MRR growth) |
| No guidance | Industry benchmarks from ChartMogul 2025 data |
| Start from scratch | Worked examples showing healthy vs. struggling SaaS |
| No prioritization | Built-in scoring systems (Impact × Votes / Effort) |
| Blank checklists | 120+ researched action items with explanations |
| Generic advice | Specific frameworks (10x Value test, 3-tier pricing builder) |
| One-size-fits-all | Customizable but not empty |

**Example:** The Revenue Tracker doesn't just have a "Churn Rate" column. It includes:
- The formula: `Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start of Month`
- A benchmark: "SaaS companies pre-$10k MRR grow 20-40% MoM. Post-$100k, 10-15% is strong."
- A worked example: "Month 3 of a $29/mo SaaS with 200 customers and 33% MoM growth"
- Target indicators: LTV:CAC >3:1, Churn <5%, Quick Ratio >4

That's the difference.

## What's Inside (All 8 Templates)

### Core 5 Templates

### 1. SaaS Launch Checklist

**The difference:** Not just "what" to do, but "how" and "why" with tool recommendations and decision frameworks.

### 2. Revenue Tracker

- **Annual Overview:** 12-month table for year-over-year tracking

**The difference:** You're not building financial models from scratch. The formulas, benchmarks, and examples are already there.

### 3. 30-Day Content Calendar
**File:** `templates/content-calendar.md`

**What free templates give you:** A blank calendar grid

**What this gives you:** A complete month of content pre-planned with proven formats:

## "What's Inside" Preview: Real Formula From Revenue Tracker

Here's what you get when you open the Revenue Tracker template (not a blank table):

```
| Metric | Formula | Benchmark | Example (Month 3, $29/mo SaaS) |
|---|---|---|---|
| MRR Growth Rate | (Net New MRR / Last Month MRR) × 100 | Pre-$10k MRR: 20-40% MoM | 33.3% |
| LTV (Lifetime Value) | ARPU / Churn Rate | Target: 3× your CAC minimum | $145 ($29 / 0.2) |
| Quick Ratio | New MRR / Churned MRR | Healthy SaaS: >4 | 3.5 ($1,740 / $490) |
| Churn Rate | Churned Customers / Total at Start | Keep under 5% monthly | 8.5% (17 / 200) |
```

Every metric includes:
- The exact formula (copy/paste into Notion)
- Industry benchmark from real SaaS data
- Worked example with realistic numbers
- Target range so you know if you're healthy

This is one table from one template. All 5 templates follow this format: real formulas, real benchmarks, real examples.

## Who This Is For

**This toolkit is for you if:**
- You're a solo founder or indie hacker building a SaaS product
- You're tired of downloading "templates" that are just empty tables
- You want proven systems, not blank pages

- You use Notion to run your business

**This is NOT for you if:**
- You're at a large company with dedicated finance/ops/marketing teams
- You prefer building every system from scratch (respect, but this isn't for you)
- You don't use Notion (these are Notion-specific markdown files)

**Honest disclosure:** This is a new product, built by an indie hacker for indie hackers. You won't find fake testimonials here. What you will find is 100+ hours of research compressed into 5 templates that give you the formulas, benchmarks, and frameworks that free templates skip.
