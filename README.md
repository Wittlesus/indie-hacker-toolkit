## What Makes This Different From Free Templates

| Free Notion Templates | This Toolkit |
|---|---|
| Empty tables | Pre-filled with realistic examples |
| Generic metrics | Real SaaS formulas (LTV, CAC, Quick Ratio) |
| No guidance | Industry benchmarks from ChartMogul 2025 |
| Start from scratch | Worked examples showing healthy vs. struggling SaaS |
| No prioritization | Built-in scoring systems |
| Blank checklists | 120+ researched action items with explanations |
| Generic advice | Specific frameworks (10x Value test, 3-tier pricing) |
| One-size-fits-all | Customizable but not empty |

**Example:** The Revenue Tracker does not just have a "Churn Rate" column. It includes:
- The formula: `Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start of Month`
- A benchmark: "SaaS companies pre-$10k MRR grow 20-40% MoM"
- A worked example: Month 3 of a $29/mo SaaS with 200 customers
- Target indicators: LTV:CAC >3:1, Churn <5%, Quick Ratio >4

---

## Quick Start

1. Purchase and download the templates
2. Open Notion and go to **Settings > Import > Markdown**
3. Upload the `.md` files from the `templates/` folder
4. Each file becomes a new Notion page with all formatting preserved

| LTV             | ARPU / Churn Rate                    | Target: 3x your CAC   | $145 ($29 / 0.2)   |
| Quick Ratio     | New MRR / Churned MRR                | Healthy SaaS: >4       | 3.5                 |
| Churn Rate      | Churned / Total at Start             | Keep under 5% monthly  | 8.5% (17 / 200)    |
