## What's Inside

### 1. SaaS Launch Checklist
**File:** `templates/saas-launch-checklist.md`

A comprehensive, battle-tested checklist covering every phase of a SaaS launch. Stop Googling "what did I forget" and follow a proven sequence.

- **Pre-Launch:** Domain, hosting, legal (privacy policy, ToS), branding
- **Technical:** Authentication, payments, transactional email, analytics, error tracking, SEO
- **Marketing:** Landing page, social profiles, email list, pre-launch buzz
- **Launch Day:** Directory submissions, social posts, email blast, monitoring
- **Post-Launch:** Feedback collection, metrics tracking, content, sustainability

Over 120 actionable checklist items. Duplicate it for every launch.

### 2. Revenue Tracker
**File:** `templates/revenue-tracker.md`

Know your numbers. This template gives you a complete financial picture every month -- MRR, churn, expenses, profit, and the key ratios that tell you if your business is healthy.

- Monthly snapshot: MRR, ARR, growth rate, churn
- Customer metrics: ARPU, LTV, trial-to-paid conversion
- Revenue breakdown by plan and by acquisition channel
- Full expense tracker by category
- Profit & loss summary
- Key health indicators with targets (LTV:CAC, Quick Ratio, etc.)
- 12-month annual overview table

### 3. 30-Day Content Calendar
**File:** `templates/content-calendar.md`

A full month of content planned out, day by day, across Twitter/X, Reddit, Indie Hackers, and your blog. Pre-filled with proven content formats and example topics for SaaS builders.

- 30 days of posts across multiple platforms
- Mix of content types: threads, short posts, articles, polls, AMAs
- Content repurposing plan (one piece of content becomes five)
- Monthly metrics tracker
- Content ideas backlog for future months
- Content strategy overview with pillars and posting frequency goals

### 4. Customer Feedback System
**File:** `templates/customer-feedback-system.md`

Stop losing track of what your users are telling you. This system captures, organizes, and prioritizes feedback from every channel.

- **Feature Requests:** Table with votes, effort, impact, and a priority scoring formula
- **Bug Reports:** Severity-based tracking with reproduction steps
- **User Interviews:** Question template + interview log + pattern analysis
- **NPS Tracking:** Monthly score tracker, follow-up question framework, verbatim log
- Feedback sources checklist so you never miss a channel

### 5. Pricing Strategy Worksheet
**File:** `templates/pricing-strategy-worksheet.md`

Pricing is the highest-leverage decision in your business. This worksheet walks you through the entire process -- from competitive research to publishing your pricing page.

- Competitor analysis table (price, value metric, positioning)
- Value metric evaluation with scoring system
- "10x Value" test to validate your price
- 3-tier pricing builder with feature gating strategy
- Pricing page copy framework (headlines, descriptions, CTAs, FAQ)
- Pricing experiments log to track changes over time

## Who Is This For?

This toolkit is built for:

- **Solo founders** building their first (or next) SaaS product

- **Bootstrappers** who need to move fast without a team
- **Side-project builders** who want to turn their project into a real business

## How to Use These Templates

### Importing into Notion

1. Open Notion and navigate to your workspace
2. Click **Import** in the sidebar (or go to Settings > Import)
3. Select **Markdown** as the import format
4. Upload the `.md` files from the `templates/` folder
5. Each file will become a new Notion page with all formatting preserved
6. Move the pages into a dedicated "Indie Hacker Toolkit" section in your workspace

### Recommended Setup

1. Create a top-level page called **"Indie Hacker Toolkit"**
2. Add each template as a sub-page
3. Duplicate the **Revenue Tracker** monthly (one page per month)
4. Duplicate the **Content Calendar** monthly
5. The **Launch Checklist** and **Pricing Worksheet** are project-level -- duplicate per product
6. The **Feedback System** is ongoing -- keep one running instance

### Customization

Every template is designed to be customized. Delete sections that don't apply to you, add rows to tables, and modify the frameworks to match your specific product and market. These are starting points, not rigid rules.
